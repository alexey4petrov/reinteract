Reinteract
==========
Reinteract is a interactive shell for Python that allows changing history, not just 
repeating it. You can go back to early statements, edit them, and the changes flow
through the rest of the subsequent code. You might think of it as a Python 'worksheet'.

This works best when you are doing things without operating system interaction, like
math, if a statement deletes a file on disk, reinteract can't undelete it.

Reinteract is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 
or later.

You can get the latest sources using git:
