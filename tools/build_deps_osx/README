This directory contains scripts and other files used to build the
dependencies required for Reinteract on OS X. It builds on top of
the excellent gtk-osx-build work done by Imendio.

  http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gtk-macosx/build-instructions

Differences here:

 - All modules are changed to build from tarballs; this allows creating
   an installer and putting up the corresponding source for download.

 - Select patches not yet in version control (or not yet in tarballs)
   are added.

 - Python is upgraded from 2.4 to 2.5

 - Extra modules (numpy and matplotlib) are added.

 - Provision is made for cross-building ppc versions of the dependencies
   on i386; the the idea is that the ppc and i386 versions of everything
   can be lipo-ed together to create a universal bundle for release.

Usage
=====

 - Run gtk-osx-build-setup.sh as described in the first step on:

     http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gtk-macosx/build-instructions

   You *don't* need to do anything else on that page.

 - Install git if you don't already have it.
   (http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/ works)

 - Checkout the Reinteract sources into ~/Source/reinteract

    cd ~/Source
    git clone git://git.fishsoup.net/reinteract

 - Run build.sh

    ~/Source/reinteract/tools/build_deps_osx/build.sh

   This builds everything and installs it into /opt/reinteract

 - Shell into the built environment

    JHB=reinteract jhbuild shell

 - Configure and build reinteract

    cd ~/Source/reinteract
    ./autogen.sh
    make

 - Run reinteract

   Reinteract.app/Contents/MacOS/Reinteract
