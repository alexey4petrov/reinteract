This directory includes a Python script and WiX scripts for building a MSI
installer for Reinteract.

To make this work, you'll need:

* All the (binary) components that go into building the installer. The
  components in each installer build are listed at:

    http://www.reinteract.org/download/Reinteract-<version>.msi.components

  with their original URLs. (The components are also mirrored in 
  the components/binary directory.)

  The non-Python components need to be installed with the bin/ directory
  in your PATH environment variable.

* WiX version 3 installed and added to your PATH. Get it from:

   http://wix.sourceforge.net/

* To build against Python-2.5, MinGW installed and added to your PATH.
  (This is used to compile the Reinteract.exe wrapper script.) Get it from:

   http://www.mingw.org/

* To build against Python-2.6, Visual Studio 2008 or 
  Visual C++ 20008 Express Edition (a free download) installed.
  
Then simply run 'python build_msi.py' from this directory, and:
  
  Reinteract-<version>-python2.N.msi
  
file will be generated. The file

  Reinteract-<version>-python2.N.msi.manifest

is a listing of all the files in the installer. This is meant for comparing
with the previous version to make sure that files haven't gone missing.

Some portions of the installer user interface are derived from an
installer I created for the Mugshot Windows client. Those portions are
Copyright Red Hat, Inc, 2006. The rest of the user interface files and
build_msi.py are Copyright Owen Taylor, 2008-2009.

All of the code and data in this directory may be used under the same 
licensing terms as the rest of Reinteract.
