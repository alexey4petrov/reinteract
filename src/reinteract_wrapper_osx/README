The "wrapper" program in this directory is used on OS X instead of
the Python main programs we use on other platforms (we use a native
wrapper on Windows to for a system install, but it's much simpler
and just invokes the Python main program directly.)

The wrapper has several functions:

 * It locates the correct copy of Python (the native Python 2.5 on
   10.5 or the python.org version for 10.4), and loads it via dlopen

 * It sets up sys.path and the global_settings path options

 * It loads the "NIB" file holding the main menu definition

 * It contains a glue module (reinterate.NativeMainMenu) that allows
   our PyGTK to enable/disable menu items

Note that this program uses *header* files from Python and from GTK+
but is statically linked only to the Cocoa frameworks. References to
Python and GTK+ symbols are done dynamically with dlopen/dlsym.

Not linking to Python is essential to allow the run-time selection of
a Python framework in different locations. Not linking to GTK+ is
not so vital, but our use of GTK+ is very small and doing that via
dlopen() makes it easier to create a universal bundle for the
application in the release process (we don't need relink the wrapper
once we've lipo'd together universal versions of the GTK+ libraries.)
